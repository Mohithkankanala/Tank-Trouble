# Tank-Trouble
Mohith, Ojas, Alex, Christian are going to make a game like Tank Trouble but with modifications. We're making a network game so that multiple players can play together on the same wifi. We're going to have a main class called Tank and subclasses of ammunation, map, players. Players shoot each other to earn points. The one with the highest points in a given time wins.
